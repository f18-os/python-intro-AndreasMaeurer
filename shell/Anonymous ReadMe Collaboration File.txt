Theory of OS Fall 2018

Collaborated:	
	I discussed redirection with Stephanie Medina
	With Sergio Ponce De Leon I discussed how to set up the shell to print to the File Descriptor, the prompt and the main loop
	With Sebastian Nunez I discussed the first couple of test cases where, if there is a / in the input, it's either an absolute 
		or relative directory so you don't go through all the PATH
	
I got help on the PS1 to get the shell script to work from David Pruitt and Edward Seymore

For the cd (change directory) function I used info from this webpage:

For redirections I got info from this webpage:
